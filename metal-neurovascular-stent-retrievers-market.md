<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Neurovascular Stent Retrievers market comprises two primary types: balloon-expanding stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expanding stents are deployed using a balloon that, when inflated, expands the stent against the vessel walls, providing rigidity and support. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed to automatically expand upon release from their delivery system, adapting to the vessel's shape. Both types aim to restore blood flow and maintain vessel patency in conditions like aneurysms and vascular occlusions, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
