<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Sump Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Pumps</li><li>Pedestal Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric sump pump market features primarily two types: submersible pumps and pedestal pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to operate underwater, effectively pushing water up through a discharge pipe, making them ideal for use in basements and areas prone to flooding. Pedestal pumps, on the other hand, are positioned above the sump pit, with a motor mounted higher than the water level, making them easier to service but typically less effective in deeper applications. Both types cater to various drainage needs.</p></p>
